I uploaded a file in the format of main.ipynb to gradescope, but the file downloaded from gradescope is main.txt.

If you already have a main.txt file, you can fix it like this: Change the file extension: Change main.txt to main.ipynb.

In addition, if you need to access the code of main.ipynb, you can also directly access this link: https://github.com/GGMUAlan/cap5771sp25-project/blob/main/cap5771sp25-project/code/main.ipynb
