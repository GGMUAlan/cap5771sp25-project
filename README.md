Please read first !!! 
I uploaded a file in the format of main.ipynb to gradescope, but the file downloaded from gradescope is main.txt.

If you already have a main.txt file, you can fix it like this:
Change the file extension: Change main.txt to main.ipynb.

In addition, if you need to access the code of main.ipynb, you can also directly access this link:
